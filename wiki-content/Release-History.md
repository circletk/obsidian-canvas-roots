## v0.10.x

### Data Enhancement Pass (v0.10.17)

Commands and UI tools to upgrade existing vaults by creating missing linked entities from existing person note data. Designed for users who imported GEDCOM before Canvas Roots supported event, place, or source note types.

See [data-enhancement-pass.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/data-enhancement-pass.md) for implementation plan.

**Use Cases:**
- Imported GEDCOM before v0.10.0: No event notes were created; birth/death dates are flat properties
- Imported GEDCOM before v0.9.0: No source notes; source citations were ignored
- Have place strings instead of wikilinks: `birthPlace: "Dublin, Ireland"` instead of `birthPlace: "[[Dublin, Ireland]]"`
- Want event notes for existing data: Retroactively create event notes to use timeline features

**Generate Place Notes (v0.10.17):**
- Scans person notes for `birth_place`, `death_place` properties
- Scans event notes for `place` properties
- Detects string values (not wikilinks) that need conversion
- Creates place notes with proper hierarchy (parents created first)
- Updates references to use wikilinks
- Preview mode shows what will be created/modified
- Matches existing place notes to avoid duplicates
- Progress indicator during bulk generation with cancel support
- Paginated results table with search/sort after completion
- Edit button on each result to open Edit Place modal

**Planned Features:**
- Generate Events from Dates: Create event notes from person `birthDate`/`deathDate` properties
- Re-parse GEDCOM for Sources: Re-import GEDCOM to extract sources, matching to existing person notes

---

### Type Customization (v0.10.3)

Full type manager for each note category: events, sources, organizations, relationships, and places. Create, edit, hide, and customize types and categories with user-defined names.

**Type Managers:**

Each Control Center tab now includes a "Manage types" card:

| Tab | Types | Features |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Events | 22 built-in event types | Custom types, categories (Core, Extended, Narrative), icon/color |
| Sources | 6 built-in source types | Custom types, categories, description |
| Organizations | 11 built-in org types | Custom types, categories |
| Relationships | 17 built-in relationship types | Custom types, color, line style (solid, dashed, dotted) |
| Places | 15 built-in place types | Custom types, categories, hierarchy level (0-99) |

**Type Management Features:**
- **Create custom types**: Add new types with full customization
- **Override built-in types**: Change name, description, icon, color
- **Hide types**: Remove from dropdowns while preserving existing notes
- **Reset to defaults**: Restore customized built-in types
- **Delete custom types**: Remove user-created types entirely

**Category Management:**
- Create custom categories to group related types
- Rename built-in categories to match your terminology
- Reorder categories with sort order field
- Hide unused categories (built-in or custom)
- "Show all" button to restore hidden categories

**Place Type Specifics:**
- Hierarchy levels (0-99) determine valid parent-child relationships
- Categories (geographic, political, settlement, subdivision, structure) organize the UI
- Users can assign place types to any category regardless of hierarchy
- Quick level presets for common hierarchy positions

**Settings Storage:**
```typescript
// Per-category settings (events shown as example)
customEventTypes: EventTypeDefinition[];
eventTypeCustomizations: Record<string, Partial<EventTypeDefinition>>;
hiddenEventTypes: string[];
customEventCategories: EventCategoryDefinition[];
categoryCustomizations: Record<string, Partial<EventCategoryDefinition>>;
hiddenCategories: string[];
```

**Use Cases:**
- Rename "birth" to "nameday" for fantasy world-building
- Add "coronation" and "succession" event types for dynasty tracking
- Create "Land Records" source type for property research
- Hide unused relationship types like "apprentice" or "mentor"
- Add "Bodies of Water" category for place types

---

### Flexible Note Type Detection (v0.10.2)

Support multiple methods for identifying Canvas Roots note types, avoiding conflicts with other plugins that use the `type` property.

**Problem Solved:**
- The generic `type` property conflicts with other plugins (Templater, Dataview, etc.)
- Some users prefer tags (`#person`) over frontmatter properties
- Need a namespaced property to avoid conflicts

**New Standard: `cr_type`**

New installations now use `cr_type` as the primary type property:
```yaml
cr_type: person
```

This aligns with the existing `cr_id` convention and avoids conflicts with other plugins.

**Detection Methods (checked in order):**
1. **`cr_type` property** - New default, namespaced to avoid conflicts (e.g., `cr_type: person`)
2. **`type` property** - Legacy fallback for existing vaults (e.g., `type: person`)
3. **Tags** - Additional fallback via tags (`#person`, `#place`, `#event`, `#source`, `#map`, `#organization`)
   - Supports nested tags (e.g., `#genealogy/person`)

**Settings:**
- **Primary type property**: Choose between `cr_type` (default) or `type` (legacy)
- **Enable tag-based detection**: Toggle tags as fallback detection method

**Supported Note Types:**
- `person` - Person notes with family relationships
- `place` - Place notes with geographic data
- `event` - Event notes for chronological mapping
- `source` - Source notes for evidence management
- `map` - Custom map configuration notes
- `organization` - Organization notes for hierarchies
- `schema` - Schema validation notes
- `proof_summary` - GPS proof summary notes

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Existing users automatically keep `type` as their primary (migrated on first load)
- Both properties are always checked (primary first, then fallback)
- Person notes with `cr_id` but no explicit type are still detected as persons
- No migration of existing notes required

---

### GEDCOM Import v2 (v0.10.1)

Enhanced GEDCOM import that creates source notes, event notes, and place notes in addition to person notes.

**Import Options UI:**
- Toggle for each note type: people, events, sources, places
- Filename format selection: Original (John Smith.md), Kebab-case (john-smith.md), Snake_case (john_smith.md)
- Per-type filename formats via "Customize per note type" toggle
- Progress modal showing import phases with running statistics
- File analysis with counts before confirming import

**Source Import:**
- Parse `SOUR` records and `@S1@`-style source references
- Create source notes (`cr_type: source`) with available metadata
- Support for `TITL`, `AUTH`, `PUBL`, `REPO` fields

**Event Import:**
- Create event notes (`cr_type: event`) for all supported GEDCOM tags:
  - **Core (4):** `BIRT`, `DEAT`, `MARR`, `DIV`
  - **Life Events (6):** `BURI`, `CREM`, `ADOP`, `GRAD`, `RETI`, `CENS`
  - **Career/Residence (3):** `RESI`, `OCCU`, `EDUC`
  - **Legal/Estate (4):** `PROB`, `WILL`, `NATU`, `MILI`
  - **Migration (2):** `IMMI`, `EMIG`
  - **Religious (8):** `BAPM`, `CHR`, `CHRA`, `CONF`, `FCOM`, `ORDN`, `BARM`, `BASM`, `BLES`
  - **Family (7):** `ENGA`, `MARB`, `MARC`, `MARL`, `MARS`, `ANUL`, `DIVF`
- Preserve date precision from GEDCOM (`ABT`, `BEF`, `AFT`, `BET`)

**Person Attributes (stored as properties):**
- `DSCR` → `physicalDescription`
- `IDNO` → `identityNumber` (sensitive - redacted from exports)
- `NATI` → `nationality`
- `RELI` → `religion`
- `TITL` → `title`
- `PROP` → `property`
- `CAST` → `caste`
- `NCHI` → `childrenCount`
- `NMR` → `marriageCount`
- `SSN` → `ssn` (sensitive - redacted from exports)

**Place Import:**
- Hierarchical place structure parsing (`City, County, State, Country`)
- Create place notes (`type: place`) with parent/child relationships
- Duplicate detection: case-insensitive matching on `full_name` property
- Fallback matching: title + parent combination for same-named places
- Update existing places (add missing parent links) instead of creating duplicates

**Performance:**
- Optimized connected components analysis (O(n+m) instead of O(n×m))
- Paginated People tab (100 at a time) for large imports
- Progress callback throughout all import phases

**Integration Points:**
- Staging folder support (import to staging, review, then merge)
- Property aliases (use configured property names)
- Value aliases (map GEDCOM event types to Canvas Roots types)
